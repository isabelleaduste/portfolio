<p>Hello there! Welcome to my website! My name is Isabellle and I am 16 years old. Short bio. I like... and dislike... Here's a fun fact about me:
Here's a link to my fav website! That's a photo of me down there and here's a screenshot of my side scroller game and this is what it does:

      <h1>June 26, 2017</h1>
      <p> Today I learned more about how circuits work. I learned how to make an LED light light up.
          Although I'm still a little confused on the differences between in series and in parallel, I think that I will soon understand them.
          My idea of robots changed by a lot because I realized how many things are actually robots. I am excited to see what the future will bring
          for robots because it will be very interesting to see how they can and may not help the world. I am also nervous about robots taking over the world
          because what will ahppen to us if robots then do everything for us? I don't want our world and people to become like how they did in the movie Wall=E. 
          In my group, I believe that we each have different strengths and weaknesses that we were able to combind well and problem solve. I think something that
          I could do better is contribute more to the dissusion or problem solving because I felt that I wasn't helping at all, but it was almost as if the 
          opprotunity never presented itself. Here is a picture of the circuit we made today. </p>

      <p>My team worked together on the lightshow by having everyone try to get the LED working and then someone coding for the timing of the lights. 
         And another person was playing the music and trying to keep it in time with the lights. We communicated well and got most of what
         we had planned on doing. I thin that our teamwork could have improved if we had more information on how to program and setup multiple lights 
         and problem solving a little better when we're stuck. THe basic pieces of every Arduino sketch is... Here is a picture of 
         our show and a picture of our code. </p>

      <p>I learned that the circuits are in like a loop and that they have coorelated positive and negative sides. I'm still a little confused on
         what circuits are and how to make them, but I'll learn (hopefully). Besides making the robot move, I would really like to program it to sing a full song.
         I'd also think it'd be cool if it were able to be controlled by a remote control so that you could tell it to go a certain direction from
          a key that you press. I also think that I would want to add a thing were it could play different songs depending on user input or 
          sensing a certain color it would play a certain song.
