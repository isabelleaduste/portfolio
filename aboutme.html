<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello there! Welcome to my website!</p>
</div> 

      <h1>June 26, 2017</h1>
                    <p> Today I learned more about how circuits work. I learned how to make an LED light light up.
                   Although I'm still a little confused on the differences between in series and in parallel, I think that I will soon understand them.
                    My idea of robots changed by a lot because I realized how many things are actually robots. I am excited to see what the future will bring
                    for robots because it will be very interesting to see how they can and may not help the world. I am also nervous about robots taking over the world
                    because what will ahppen to us if robots then do everything for us? I don't want our world and people to become like how they did in the movie Wall=E. 
                    In my group, I believe that we each have different strengths and weaknesses that we were able to combind well and problem solve. I think something that
                    I could do better is contribute more to the dissusion or problem solving because I felt that I wasn't helping at all, but it was almost as if the 
                    opprotunity never presented itself. Here is a picture of the circuit we made today. </p>
